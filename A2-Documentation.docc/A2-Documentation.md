# ``AssignmentTwo``

3701ICT
Assessment 1 / Milestone 2

## Overview

The project is started from week 3

In week 3 and 4, I've learnt about:
- SwiftDoc/DocC
- High order functions
- Class & Protocols
- TextField & Button
- Display Images
- Enums
- Further Struct content
- Optional Data Types
- If and Guard
- Error Handling
- Data persistance through JSON
- Edit/Add/Remove


This Milestone has implemented:
- A master/detail view
- Minimalist pages, simple and sleek
- SwiftDoc
- No unit tests as there are no functions currently implemented
- A design focused on Seperation of Concerns, without implementing more than necessary for M2.

The demonstration can be found within the zip file, labelled Demonstration.mov
