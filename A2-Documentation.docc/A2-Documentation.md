Assessment 1 / Milestone 3

## Overview

During Milestone 3, I've learnt more about:
- SwiftDoc/DocC
- Class & Protocols
- Optional data
- More on Guards
- Error Handling
- Data persistance through JSON, some information on Core Data also.


This Milestone has implemented:
- A master/detail view
- Minimalist pages, simple and sleek
- SwiftDoc's
- A design focused on Seperation of Concerns
- Full data persistence including checklist sub-items.

Takeaways:
- For me, incremental development is hard, I find it easier to think of a whole project when trying to write modular code, so milestones 1 & 2 where difficult for me, where as this one I felt I had the freedom to create what I wanted, without cutting corners or feel like I'm doing too much.
- I still have a ways to go in understanding protocols, and how they can change the way I work with Swift.
- I also still have a ways to go in understanding Bindings. I have a simple understanding but they are incredibly strong, and I'm sure could be utilised in a much more effective way.

The demonstration can be found within the zip file, labelled Demonstration.mov
